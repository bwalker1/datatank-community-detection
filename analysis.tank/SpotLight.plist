Don't mess with this
This is the datatask file that contains the input information
Extract the data out of the datatask file in the form of a 3d path series
The resolution parameter - higher value will lead to a partition into smaller communities.
The temporal parameter - higher value will lead to nodes more likely to stay in same cluster
This module converts the 3d path series to a 3d point series
Convert the input times into time bins
This module converts the 3d point series data into a (dense) weighted adjacency matrix</string>
