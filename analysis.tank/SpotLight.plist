The resolution parameter - higher value will lead to a partition into smaller communities.
The temporal parameter - higher value will lead to nodes more likely to stay in same cluster
Here, convert to a 3d point set - modify as needed if you only want a subset of points
Convert the input times into time bins
This module converts the 3d point series data into a (dense) weighted adjacency matrix
